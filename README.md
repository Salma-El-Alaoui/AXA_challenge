### TODO: 

- work around the problem in the seasonal plots where the x axis has values (not dates) : resample to months? or days?


### INSTALL:
- if statemodel isn't installed on your machine, you do not have the right version of statsmodels. Please do
 pip install git+https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels.git
